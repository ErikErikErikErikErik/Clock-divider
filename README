Code for David Haillants uC Clock divider
https://www.davidhaillant.com/uc-clock-divider/

This project is written for an Arduino Nano Every

Debounce time and clock divisions are adjusted by changing the values in the main.cpp file, under loop(). 
These are found under the // CONFIGURE THE MODULE HERE comment. 
A division value of 1 will duplicate the incoming clock signal to the output.
